# Animated Examples

### Animated Methods - Part 1

Here have a Button and an Animated.View. Click the Button and the View becomes opaque. Click it again and the View becomes transparent.

Take a close look at what happens. On click the Animated.Value will time to the 'toValues' mention in the onPressButton function.

Try fiddling around with the 'toValues' and the styles of the Animated.View.
